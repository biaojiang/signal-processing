# Combined README

## 📘 Statistical Learning Notes

# Signal Processing Techniques
To be continuously updated, and all the files will be mainly based in `Python`.

## Repo structure
1. [src/filter](src/filter) is the digital filter design.
1. [notebooks/statistical_learning](notebooks/statistical_learning) includes the `.py` and `.ipynb` files for the examples in the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/).

## 🔊 Signal Processing Projects

A collection of projects and implementations focused on **Discrete-Time Signal Processing**, inspired by the textbook by *Alan V. Oppenheim* and real-world DSP challenges.

### 📚 Inspiration

This section is grounded in the principles from:

> **Discrete-Time Signal Processing**  
> *Alan V. Oppenheim, Ronald W. Schafer, John R. Buck*

### 🧠 Topics Covered

- Digital filters (FIR, IIR, Kalman filters)
- Linear regression in signal analysis
- Spectral analysis and transforms
- Signal reconstruction and sampling theory
- Sensor data denoising and prediction
- Real-world audio and time series processing

### ⚙️ Technologies

- Python 3
- NumPy, SciPy
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib, seaborn

### 📌 Goals

- Reinforce theoretical DSP concepts with Python-based practice.
- Build a library of practical signal processing examples.
- Share useful tools and code for both beginners and professionals.

### 🚧 In Progress

This repo is a work-in-progress. New chapters, filters, and real-world datasets will be added regularly.
